Help me implement the feature or fix the bug described in a GitHub Issue
as a senior engineer would.

Here are the details from GitHub:

Implement comprehensive "Session Catalog" page at /catalog that displays all conference sessions as interactive tiles and provides robust filtering functionality.

Objective:
Enhance the user experience by allowing attendees to easily browse, search, and filter sessions based on various criteria.

Data Source:
The conference-website/src/data/sessions.ts file should be kept in sync with the content of schedule.md. Utilize the SESSIONS array exported from conference-website/src/data/sessions.ts as the primary data source for all session information displayed on the catalog page.

Functional Requirements:
Session Display:
 
Each session should be displayed as a visually distinct and interactive tile on the /catalog page.
Each tile should minimally show: title, speaker, time, day, category, and location.
Clicking on a session tile should navigate the user to a SessionDetail page (e.g., /catalog/:sessionId) displaying all available details for that session.
Filtering & Search:

Implement filter controls on the /catalog page. Attendees should be able to filter sessions by:
Day: Day 1, Day 2, Day 3
Category: Breakout, Customer Story, Learning Lab, Keynote, Expo
Speaker: A searchable/selectable list of all unique speakers.
Level: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced (from session.details.level)
Tracks: A searchable/selectable list of all unique tracks (from session.details.tracks)
Add a general search bar that filters sessions based on keywords found in the title, description, speaker, or fullDescription.
Filters should be combinable (e.g., "Day 1" AND "Keynote").
The URL should reflect the active filters (e.g., /catalog?day=Day1&category=Keynote).
Technical Considerations:
Component Structure: Modify conference-website/src/pages/Catalog.tsx to display session tiles and integrate filter controls. You may need to create new sub-components for individual session tiles and filter groups.
State Management: Manage the filtered sessions and active filter states efficiently. Consider using React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo) for local state or a global state solution if deemed necessary by existing project patterns.
Styling: Maintain consistency with the existing Tailwind CSS and conference-website component styling. Ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes.
Performance: Optimize rendering for a potentially large number of sessions to ensure a smooth user experience.
Routing: Ensure react-router-dom is correctly configured for the /catalog and /catalog/:sessionId routes.
Acceptance Criteria:
All sessions from sessions.ts are displayed correctly on the /catalog page.
All specified filter options are present and functional.
Searching by text effectively narrows down the session list.
Navigating to a session's detail page works as expected, displaying all relevant information.
The UI is responsive and adheres to the project's design language.
Existing unit tests for Catalog.test.tsx and SessionDetail.test.tsx (if any) are updated, and new tests are added to cover the filtering logic and UI interactions.

**Goal:** Implement the requested feature or fix the bug safely and correctly.

Follow best practices and coding standards.

**Process:**

1.  **Explore:** Read the issue description above. Then, examine the relevant parts of the codebase. Do NOT start coding yet.
2.  **Plan:** Propose a detailed step-by-step implementation plan. List exactly which files you will create or modify.
3.  **Confirm:** You MUST stop and ask me for confirmation to proceed with the plan before writing code or calling the edit or write tools.
4.  **Execute:** Only after I explicitly approve the plan, proceed to write the code and tests.
