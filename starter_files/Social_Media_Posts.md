## Post 1: The "100x Developer" (Motivational/Twitter)

**Text:**
"Using AI to 10x yourself is easy. 100x-ing? That’s where the real magic happens." 🪄✨

In our latest episode, Gemini CLI creator Taylor Mullen drops some serious wisdom on scaling your productivity and why "doing what a person would do" is the secret sauce to building better agents.

Stop reading docs and start automating. 🚀

## Post 2: The Self-Healing Agent (Tech/LinkedIn)

**Text:**
Ever wish your tools could fix themselves? 🛠️

We watched the Gemini CLI "self-heal" live during a demo. It hit a wall, analyzed the error, and figured out a workaround on its own—even spinning up a GitHub Pages site when it couldn't find a deploy button! 🤯

This isn't just a CLI; it's an agentic loop in action.

Check out the deep dive with Taylor Mullen on *The Agent Factory*.

## Post 3: Open Source & Trust (Community/Dev.to)

**Text:**
Transparency > Black Boxes. 📦🚫

Why is Gemini CLI open source? Because when an agent is running on your machine, you need to trust it.

Taylor Mullen shared that the team (and community!) ships ~150 features a week. How? They use the CLI to build the CLI. The ultimate dogfooding. 🐶🥣

Dive into the philosophy of trust-based AI tools in our new blog post!

## Post 4: Live Vibe Coding (Engagement/Instagram)

**Text:**
Live vibe coding with the Gemini CLI! 💻✨

We skipped the "clone repo" step and just asked the agent to do it. It researched, found the link, and handled the rest.

If you're still manually cloning repos in 2026, you're missing out. 😉
